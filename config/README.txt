This application reads Agilent Feature Extraction (FE) output files from an ATAC microarray experiment and classifies the samples as "red" or "blue".

Extract all the files in this package to a directory of your choice. To run the analysis, double lick on ATACanalysis.bat in the bin subdirectory, and tell it the path to the FE output files to be analyzed.

It's recommended that the user create a tab delimited text file named "HybSummary.txt" in the same directory as the FE output files. This file should contain columns labeled "Array" and "Sample". It can contain other columns also. For each FE output file, the software generates an array name consisting of an “S”, followed by the last five digits of the slide barcode, followed by the subarray designation, if any. For example, Feature Extraction produces an output file named SG19018632_258579010004_4_17_19_S001_CGH_1201_Sep17_2_1.txt from subarray 2_1 of slide 258579010004. The array name of this sample will be S10004_2_1. These array names of FE files should be entered in the Array column of the HybSummary file, paired with a user defined sample name in the Sample column. This allows the software to label its output more intelligently.
